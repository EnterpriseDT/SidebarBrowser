Sidebar Browser: Run Chrome in a Windows 10 sidebar (aka AppBar)
================================================================

Runs Chrome in a Windows side-bar (aka AppBar).  This is different from just docking to the side of the screen in that Windows reserves the side of the screen for the application such that other apps only have access to the rest of the screen.  It also plays nice with the Windows 10 notification panel (that's dragged out from the right of the screen), placing it next to the Sidebar Browser window.

The source is essentially a merge of [CefSharp's Minimal Example](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp.MinimalExample) and the code in Mad__'s article named [AppBar using C#](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6741/AppBar-using-C).
